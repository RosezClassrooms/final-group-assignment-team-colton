# Group-Assignment
I chose to use the Strategy pattern as well as the Template pattern. The strategy pattern is used to extend the student class and provide different strategies for prioritizing work and assignments. 

I added the Template pattern to this program to allow for the student to decide whether an activity is rejuvenating or taxing to them. The template pattern allows for different implementaion of the set_effect() function depending on the classification of activity.
